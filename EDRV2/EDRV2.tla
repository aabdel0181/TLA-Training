EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets

CONSTANTS
  GPUs,               \* Set of all GPUs
  Marketplaces        \* Set of all marketplaces

VARIABLES
  gpuStatus           \* Map from (marketplace, gpu) to status

\* Possible statuses for a GPU
Status == {"healthy", "error_detected", "resolution_requested", "resolved", "escalated"}

\* Type invariant to ensure variables maintain correct types
TypeInvariant ==
  /\ gpuStatus \in [Marketplaces -> [GPUs -> Status]]

\* Initialize all GPUs to healthy
Init ==
  /\ gpuStatus = [m \in Marketplaces |-> [g \in GPUs |-> "healthy"]]

\* Define actions that can occur in the system

\* A healthy GPU encounters an error
DetectError(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "healthy"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "error_detected"]

\* Request resolution for a GPU with detected error
RequestResolution(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "error_detected"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "resolution_requested"]

\* Successfully resolve the error
ResolveError(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "resolution_requested"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "resolved"]

\* Escalate the error for manual intervention
EscalateError(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "resolution_requested"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "escalated"]

\* Resolved GPU returns to healthy
RecoverToHealthy(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "resolved"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "healthy"]

\* Escalated GPU gets manually fixed and becomes resolved
ManualIntervention(m, g) ==
  /\ m \in Marketplaces
  /\ g \in GPUs
  /\ gpuStatus[m][g] = "escalated"
  /\ gpuStatus' = [gpuStatus EXCEPT ![m][g] = "resolved"]

\* Define the next-state relation
Next ==
  \E m \in Marketplaces, g \in GPUs:
    \/ DetectError(m, g)
    \/ RequestResolution(m, g)
    \/ ResolveError(m, g)
    \/ EscalateError(m, g)
    \/ RecoverToHealthy(m, g)
    \/ ManualIntervention(m, g)

\* Safety Property: Only allow valid state transitions
SafeTransitions == [][
  \A m \in Marketplaces:
    \A g \in GPUs:
      LET old == gpuStatus[m][g]
          new == gpuStatus'[m][g]
      IN
        \/ old = new  \* No change is always valid
        \/ /\ old = "healthy"
           /\ new = "error_detected"
        \/ /\ old = "error_detected"
           /\ new = "resolution_requested"
        \/ /\ old = "resolution_requested"
           /\ new \in {"resolved", "escalated"}
        \/ /\ old = "resolved"
           /\ new = "healthy"
        \/ /\ old = "escalated"
           /\ new = "resolved"
]_gpuStatus

\* Liveness Property: Every detected error eventually gets resolved
ErrorEventuallyResolved ==
  \A m \in Marketplaces:
    \A g \in GPUs:
      (gpuStatus[m][g] = "error_detected") ~>
        (gpuStatus[m][g] = "resolved" \/ gpuStatus[m][g] = "escalated" \/ gpuStatus[m][g] = "healthy")

\* Liveness Property: Every escalated error eventually gets manually resolved
EscalatedEventuallyResolved ==
  \A m \in Marketplaces:
    \A g \in GPUs:
      (gpuStatus[m][g] = "escalated") ~> (gpuStatus[m][g] = "resolved" \/ gpuStatus[m][g] = "healthy")

\* Add fairness conditions for liveness properties to hold
Fairness ==
  /\ \A m \in Marketplaces, g \in GPUs:
      /\ WF_gpuStatus(RequestResolution(m, g))
      /\ WF_gpuStatus(ResolveError(m, g))
      /\ WF_gpuStatus(ManualIntervention(m, g))
      /\ WF_gpuStatus(RecoverToHealthy(m, g))
